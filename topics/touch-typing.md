# Touch Typing

You will probably spend most of your life interacting with a computer. Keyboards are the primary input method for computers, and knowing to [touch type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing) will make your interactions with these machines much more natural and efficient. Here are some tips and tools that might be helpful:
- Use a learning platform. You may want to set up a deliberate practice routine to work on it and develop muscle memory. I had a great experience with [Typing](https://www.typing.com/).
- If you already touch type, a game like [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/) once in a while might be a good place to hone skills or check your current typing speed.
