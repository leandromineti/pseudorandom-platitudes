# Learn English

If English is not your first language, start here. English is the primary language used throughout the tech industry, and being able to use it professionally should be a top priority on a learning backlog. Here are some tips and tools that might be helpful:
- Hire a teacher. A language learning app may offer a good starting place if that is not an option. I used [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) for that.
- Use [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) to increase your vocabulary. Create an English deck on [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and add new words as they appear in your studies.
- When an original movie is in English, try to watch it with English subtitles. It helps in improving your listening skills.
- Practice English writing every time you can. A writing assistant app can help you increase your confidence and give some feedback on common mistakes. I use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) for that.
